'lcurve' is for modelling of light curves.

Installation order: subs --> colly, binary --> roche --> lcurve

The file called 'Lcurve' that is generated in this directory defines
aliases (csh-style) and prints a help message when sourced.

Installation can be painful I'm afraid, but I don't have the time to make
a better job of it I am afraid. For details, please see:

This version allows python to call function in DLLs or shared libraries ([ctypes.CDLL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)). 
The python wrapper of lcurve is [pylcurve](https://github.com/lidihei/pylcurve), which is written by Jiao Li (lijiao@bao.ac.cn).
